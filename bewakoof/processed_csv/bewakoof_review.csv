Despite returning the product on May 12, 2024, and multiple follow-ups through the Bewakoof app and emails, I have yet to receive my refund."
yash93411,Bewakoof stands out fashionable clothes,"Bewakoof stands out as one of the leading internet retailers for fashionable clothes foods and accessories in India . Being a regular customer myself and enthusiastic about Internet shopping, I would like to explain my perception of this particular e-commerce site."
raghavprakhar8,Order Delay,"I placed an order for a bag through the Bewakoof app on May 5th, 2024. Despite receiving confirmation of my order, I am still waiting for it to be delivered. Initially, the delivery date was set for May 8th, 2024, but I received a notification of a delay due to operational issues. I kindly request that my order be delivered as soon as possible.  and the worst  thing bewakoof  app dont have any customer care support   number ."
rahultagra32,Worst shopping app,Never do shopping on bewakoof placed an order on 21 but not shipped yet and no response from those always told wait for 48 hours they are doing fraud or nothing and very bad customer service also don't buy from bewakoof lets protest against them and raise a complaint against them in consumer court then they understand.
pralayrudradutta,Worst experience!!,"I placed an order with Bewakoof on April 17th, and it's now April 25th, and my order hasn't even shipped yet! What a disappointment! I have made the full payment. I've reached out to customer support multiple times, but all I get is the runaround. They promise to call back within 15 minutes, but guess what? No callback! It's been 8 days of frustration, and I still don't have my order. Bewakoof, you've truly lived up to your name with this one – what a bunch of Bewakoofs!"
tpgodaba,Cheaters,I had ordered two dress. One they sent sliders. And other it was larger size for which I placed return and refund. Their agent came and picked the item.but  updated as return pick up failed. After I contacted bewakoof over mail.since they dont have conact no. They sent automated mail as if they are really investigating the issue. This continued several time but no reponse. Its more than a month now. Their pick up agent will.call and ask for pick up and I inform them they have already picked up and have not updated the system . He will ask me to contact bewakoof. And same repeates again and again. They have not refunded yet and have taken the item also
amydecker06,Very Very bad customer service,They took my tshirt pickup and did not initiate the refund and are delaying by sending useless emails.
selenophilekari24,Making fool customers,Their intention is not Good. They fool customers. I don't think it's a good thing to buy from bewakoof.
thesinghneha1991,Worst experience with bewkoof,The name justify everything. They are making fool of us. I bought a t shift online when it got delivered I saw there is a hole in the T-shirt. Same day I requested for return pickup but it’s been almost 1 week it is not picked up and moreover I have been raising ticket everyday but getting no response. They mention like they will give us a call in next 15 min but I never received any call. Such a pathetic service
nilimd,Bought without checking reviews,"My mistake!  First buy was an oversize t-shirt. Liked it. Bought two more t-shirts which were very ordinary material and a jogger..the jogger was wrong size. Tried for a week writing to their care@ bewakoof.com, the only customer care available, despite a promise of one-two day return pick up, I was told to self send after a week."
Parvez_76,Stitching problem,I placed my first order in previous month and delivered with a slight delay of 3 days. The quality of the fabric is good but not the stitching for one of the 2 shorts. Over stitching at many please with threads out.
ronaldoeminem07,"Bewakoof, the name itself reveals it's intentions","I saw an extraordinary Batman themed slipper on the app and instantly ordered it, paying online. However when the order was delivered, instead of the Batman slipper, there was a shitty black and white slipper, which looked like it was 5 years in use. Then I reached out to support email and asked them to make a return order. They asked me for the pictures of the tag, I submitted everything. But now they are telling me that my order can't be replaced and be careful next time !!"
raajeevthaakural,Worst experience,Don't buy it from Bewakoof.com. They have cheated me. They are not refunding my money and giving the reason that some suspicious activity is reported on my account. Money from my wallet has been blocked and now it is showing zero and my account has been blocked and no response from them. Cheating with customers. Bad experience. Never expected this from them.
Dinesh3o,Worst quality,"I ordered 3 shirts white, blue and burgundy. All of these shirts are polyester made and none of them feels like actual cotton."
rshivang12345,Wrost experience,I ordered a Tshirt but it was oversized so I contacted support for replacement. And then they said you should've purchased after knowing your size and with proper measurement with inchtape.
poojam2790,Pathetic Service,Terrible website at all.
sudarsanaroy1,Worthless Bewakoof,"This is the worst shopping app. I had ordered 3tshirts on 9.10.23 which was supposed to be delivered by 14.10.23. But it got delayed. I even considered it as I understand there was Durga Puja rush but today it's 25.10.23 and I still didn't get the t-shirts. I used to get out for delivery updates where the delivery agent's numbers were provided sometimes they picked up and told me that my parcel will be delivered shortly which obviously didn't happen, and most of the time the delivery agents didn't receive my calls. I contacted the customer service on 18.10.23 and I was assured that I would get my parcel within next 48 hrs. But it never came and I also stopped tracking my order. Totally worthless app and very poor unhelpful service. The company is making people ""Bewakoof"". And even if the parcel come after this I am surely not accepting it and would warn people to never use this app."
gazalk300,Terrible customer service,"Terrible, Terrible customer service. They are only doing a good job in advertising. Have poor customer service, don't even have a customer care helpline, you can just email them which they won't respond to."
maheye2439,Bewakoof banate hai customer ko,"I have been emailing and messaging bewakoof for the past 10 days(ticket id 2690347) regarding the refund of my wallet money however there hasn't been a single response to my request for money transfer. Please note you are withholding my money illegally and there is no helpline or way to contact you. This shouldn't have been so unpleasant for a long time customer, it is terribly troubling to say the least. Please contact me if you are not a fraud company, thank you."
mamuzamil2,Worst service don't buy,They won't respond and they give you worst service
anikbansal1,Fraud,They don't respond to exchange requests.
ababab17,Bewakoof banate hai customer ko,"I have been emailing and messaging bewakoof for the past 10 days(ticket id 2690347) regarding the refund of my wallet money however there hasn't been a single response to my request for money transfer.

meeravigraham,Returns and Exchange are a big problem,The product quality is good. However their return and exchange process is very bad. They blame the courier always. I had bought so many things from them that needed no exchange. Then i bought a pink joggers. The size mentioned on website was for full joggers. What i got was three-fourth pants that came to just below my knees. So i am trying to return it. I keep getting a recorded call from them that courier told them I have cancelled the return pick-up!!!!  I have most certainly NOT cancelled return pick up and I have not received any call from any courier. So the joggers are still with me and they are useless.
algotrust61,Best online shopping app in India????,I am used to buy t shirts on bewakoof online shopping app. But after new update the app is become pretty slow and time taking. Please found the bug and fix it. Much love ?
Deepika007784,Big time Thuggers,Never buy anything directly from their personal website. They never return your money if you resend the product. They force to buy something else and never ship all items. 1 item is always short and they say we have delivered it.
yesiamorganic,Bewakoof know as a Tshirts Brand. They are pro.,"I am a Tshirts lover. I used to buy many t-shirts on different different shopping apps.

shilpiag0308,Extremely Worst and Pathetic Services,There is no resolution to the queries. Wrong number is updated on the portal and customer executive takes least interest in solving the issue. Despite several email reminders no respond is received and refund is processed. Pick up of the products gets failed multiple times only because of no queries attended my customer service center. Attaching below photos of return failed of the product due to the negligence of customer executives
aashokbhaii123,I recently ordered some clothes from BEWAKOOF,"I recently ordered some clothes from BEWAKOOF and was really disappointed. The quality of the fabric was not at all what I expected and the sizing chart was completely off. It's really frustrating as it seems they are letting unreliable sellers list their products on the website without any proper checks on quality or accuracy. It's a shame because otherwise, their collection is amazing."
deshsapna2050,Exchange policy,"I am not at all satisfied with your return policy. No one clarifies how to go about. On the app, orders aren't updated. No clarity and easy return policy as others. I am trying since 3 days about exchanging my products due to size issue. But no help. Disappointed!"
abj26cj,Poor service,"This brand doesn't refund ur money on return of your items easily, More than 20 days have been passed since i had returned some of my items but they haven't refunded my money. Moreover they are not even replying my mails."
udaybagdi10,Money=Not worth from bewakoof products,Worst side forever.Don't order anything.
ajayaravind1010,Customer care = policy addressers,"Bought a tshirt on ""flash sale"", little did I know flash sale means items cannot be returned."
reddyrambabu615,Returnes but no redund,Bewakoof is fake company. Quality is worst.
osooldsoul69,They Tack Reviews seriously. Which is important.,"I have been using BEWAKOOF for months and it has been an incredible time-saver. The interface is user-friendly, the creators are responsive to feedback, and I have never had any issues with bugs or crashes. I would love to see some updates, though! The app relies on a lot of surveys which can be frustrating and limit creativity. Overall, it's a solid app and I recommend it!"
ajaysolanki4687,VERY BAD QUALITY,QUALITY IS VERY BAD AND COUPNE APPLY ON WAST DO NOT SHOPPING FOR  WAST YOUR MANY AND NO CUSTOMER HELP LINE NUMBER AVAILABLE

It showed to deliver by 05.11.22 however till 06.11.22 12.40pm it is still showing ""preparing your order, yet to be shipped"". It was supposed to be a birthday gift.

ayeshavs525,Horrible customer service,I placed a order for back cover i received wrong back cover...they did not arrange reverse pick up neither they processed refund. I followed up with them from 2 months. No update from them. I recommend not to buy products from them they are fraud... I request ppl not to waste your money or else you guys will become bewakoof. It is bakwas fraudsters website with horrible customer service
khadeerwriteme,Do not trust when they say easy returns.,I have been following up bewakoof team from past 20 days regarding a refund i am yet to receive from them. They have no standards and i can understand a small business like this acts like this. Sent them 5 emails they only send you automated response. Cheap website no standards at all
renish137,One of the best online shopping app in India????,Bewakoof has so many trendy and cool design of clothing and also pocket friendly and has very good quality. There customer service are so fast and easy. Must recommended. ????
chandrakalabenpat,"User-friendly app, and easy to find product.","Recently I had some minor glitches but they were fixed within hours, so it's not really worth mentioning.I've been a customer of BEWAKOOF for the past few years. I have faced no issues with them and they are my go-to clothing store. I am very satisfied with the quality of their clothes and find that they are a great value for money. It's been a great experience so far and I will continue"

Thank you, BEWAKOOF! #recommended."
madhukhandai,Failed to order,"Today I had a very bad experience. I had selected two items and tried to order it at least 10 times. But the app asked for OTP while selecting my saved address. I received OTPs but couldn't access the space wherein I had to copy the OTP. I tried many times, then got so frustrated that I uninstalled the app out of frustration. Till today I had a good experience."
shikhasoni8101992,Worst Experience,"ORDER# 50038932. I placed order of customized tshirt. For more than a week order status was design under approval. Later there was delay in the delivery. It took more than 15 days for the order to get delivered. And when the order arrived, I received wrong product. It was a gift for some one, and when people go for customize product there is sentiment attached to it. Because of their mistake I had to face embarrassment. On following up with customer care, they said it will take 48 hours to resolve the issue. It took 4 days to get the update from them. Later I got the update they have placed replacement order, for which I asked them to change the address. But I got the reply they cannot change the address. This is like worst service ever. I requested a lot to change the order but they just did not agree. Later I told them to simply cancel the order and place new order with new address. They denied that as well. Later I got refund of the tshirt, even while refunding they deducted rs.6 because I had receive rs.6 as cashback for that tshirt. I did the payment through card btu I got the refund in bewakoof wallet. Cheap brand, poor service, product quality deteriorating, worth management thats all I can say. I was old customer, I was a tribe member, but now I am uninstalling the app forever and I will never buy anything from bewakoof and will ask my friends and relatives to do the same. Highly disappointed"

Then i mailed them as there help bot was always on outofservice duty. They replied me that it is under process and will be shiped, but till now it is not shiped so i mailed them again and again they said we will check the status. Again for third time i mailed them they said customization will not be done and ordered has been cancelled and refund will be processed but in orders still it is showing under approval and no cancellation has been processed."
liliv92898,I am very pleased with my last purchase and order,"I am very pleased with my last purchase and order. BEWAKOOF has quality t-shirts that fit me perfectly and I love the color as well. I thought it was a bit too expensive, but after wearing it for a few days, I think it's worth the price."

When I request for return/replacement, it was rejected citing tag was not there. Surprisingly courier boy did not come , still they were sure tag is not there. Yes Tag was not there and I have received the same way."
seriyis201,Best online store for clothing and accessories.,BEWAKOOF is by far the best online store for clothing and accessories.
usrajpurohitoffic,Clothes are not so skin friendly,"I bought 2 pant and 3 t shirt fullsleeve, , , quality was low, , , photo of product was amazing, but not so skin friendly, , , please"
praniths,Awestruck by Bewakoof's products,"I just have one word to express about this brand regarding its quality, collection, t-shirts, and delivery. It's outstanding! The designs are unique."
ayandevmusic,Quirkiest eCommerce Store out there!,I have been using Bewakoof products since I was in college and haven't stopped since because of their relevant designs and pocket friendly nature!
Ravii529,It's so catchy! I juts love T-shirt.,I bought one of their tees a few months ago and the quality is second to none. It's super soft and has withstood many washes. I love graphic design too. It's so catchy!
poojavediappan,Worst Quality Products,I ordered two Glass phone cases one for 1+ and the other one was for Samsung which was priced at 499 per case. When it was delivered it looked like a very cheap case and i returned both. Again I ordered a similar designer hard cover for both the phones and one was faded and the other one looked good. I did not have the patience to return the case and order a new one and so I started using it. Just in two weeks the case broke!!!!! Don't ever buy any products from them. It is of very low quality.
naushingreat,Still waiting for my phone case,I ordered a phone cover.  Its been a week past the delivery date. The initial customer care response was they will resolve it withig 2 3 days. Its been about a week but still the status of the order is not yet shipped.
Voiceup,Not worth the time and money,"I ordered during the black friday sale on 26th Nov 2021  and the delivering date was 30th Nov 2021 , since then am waiting for my Order. Horrible customer service and pathetic delivery partner. After continous follow up with their customer service team I received an update which was, one of my order is misplaced by logistics and the second order is not traceable. When i asked for refund in my bank account they credited my bewakoof wallet. Seriously guys!!! Now they want me shop again and keep tracking the orders. Crazy itsnt it....Feel trapped"
ayeshanikhat27,BEWAKOOF IS MAKING CUSTOMERS BEWAKOOF,"I am writing this review to request everyone not to buy anything from Bewakoof.This App is fraud.I ordered 2 products in Nov and was due on 5th Dec 2021.Today it 12th Dec and status still shows ready to ship. When I am trying to cancel order, it says you cannot cancel.I wrote to their customer service, no reply.I mean this is just pure BS.Wish there was a zero or minus to rate."
ankit24jha,Bewakoofi at their max,Delivery is a big issue with bewakoof. For them delay of 15-20 days is a normal thing. They will keep the product for 20 days in local godown but will not deliver it to customer. I really don't know what fun they are getting out of it.
joymndl91,Refund,Maine doo product ek sath order kiya.. Ek too delivered hua 14 din baad. Aur dusra product shipped nahi hua 4 din se too Maine cancel kar diya..10 din ho gaya refund nahi mila.. Aaj kaal kar kar K ghuma raha hai.. Bewakoof sach mein logo ko bewakoof bana raha hai.
90nidhikapoor,STOP FOOLING PEOPLE,Bewakoof as the name suggests you guys are making us FOOL. You think we are mad. We use hard earned money to do online shopping. In this pandemic situation almost everyone is using online shopping as we trust in the brands and believe our money is not wasted or we are not fooled.
elatecrmindia,Stunning Kurta collection they have,"I have recently purchased a couple of kurtas for my father as he wears them frequently from the official website of Bewakoof. The quality has come out to be extremely good to my surprise. Also, the budget that I had kept in my mind was fulfilled. Therefore, I would state that this shopping website is one of the best websites in India for purchasing clothes of every kind. The best part is the addition of health and beauty care products to all the ever-growing collections of clothes. This has given more agencies to people to choose from so many options. So, I would surely recommend all my fellow customers to shop from Bewakoof.com."
rjtalwar9818,Awesome products with various offers,"Value of money! You must try this site if your are looking for great t-shirts. This is not the first time that I have purchased something from Bewakoof. It’s been quite some time and now I am a regular customer at their shopping store. Keeping the intense summer in mind, I thought of getting my hands on some modern-day printed Kurtis that I can either wear to my office or on various occasions. I wanted something basic and classy so that there is no need to do extra when it comes to dressing up. Bewakoof gave me the agency to try out the best Kurtis which are not only comfortable to the body but also are extremely pocket-friendly. I got a handful of Kurtis at a price range, one cannot even imagine. Along with that, I enrolled myself with their Tribe M embership, so that I get instantly notified if there is a new ongoing sale or offer. My experience has been quite pleasant here."
affiliateassest,Great product,"I have seen many reviews regarding bewakoof, most of them were not good, but when I ask 4 friend and they were telling positive feedback regarding the Bewakoof, I was bit confuse whom to trust. Then I decided to give a try. I order the t-shirt from them. After receiving the product which delivered on time as approx given. product quality was good. overall my experience was good. But still people are complain about them negative in the reviews."
malhotrakanika03,Great Product No Doubt,"I have recently purchased a few comfy t-shirts for this simmer season from bewakoof for the first time. I was also in doubt of product quality but my shock the product have came out to be good. I was looking for the good texture t-shirts so that even in extream hot weather, I feel comfortable wearing it. This time I also got some discount on my purchase t shirts. So personally this has been a great experience from beginning to end. I am now looking forward to getting some winter collection for bewakoof. Now I am going buy some hoodies & jackets."
churchillyadav1,Worst customer service like EVER,"Using bewakoof.com has prooven to be a great mistake from my end. I placed an order of nearly 2k on 2nd of July for a friend's birthday which was on 10th. I paid it online and kept waiting for my delivery. Surprisingly I am still waiting for it after almost a month. My products were never delivered to my location for 10-15 days and then it said that it was returned to the warehouse. I have written several mails regarding the issue to bewakoof support team getting many ticket no.s as response regarding which  no one has ever contacted me and thet close the ticket just like that from their end.  I pleaded, I argued, finally i threatened that i'll file a complaint against the firm, but even then bewakoof gave no fk to the issue i was facing. Till date i can see my order in warehouse and my money with you guys."
saitfiroz,Worst e-commerce experience,"They make you feel like bewakoof, name suits them very well!"
sathishkalloor,"Perfectly Named, Caption ""Making people Bewakoof""","I had purchased few tshirts and joggers from them. Returned few defected products and some due to fittings issue. They never refunded the money and gave a code which we can use only for selected items. I tried the code 2-3 times and it was showing invalid. Their delayed customer services came up with new reasons every time, when I understood this is a fraud website and they want to loot money from public. & Worst part they dont have any customer care number where we can talk to someone responsible. Never Purchase from here."
priyankasony74,Waste app,"Never expect for refund back in this app, waste worst worst and I'm I can blame all the app members for their fake app"
pallavikumarinaya,Refund related,Hadd hai delivery boy kab ka product lekr chla gya fhir bhi mere paise abhi tak mujhe nhi mila or email kiye to msg aaya order pickup nhi hua h kyu sbko pgl bna rhe ho mera refund mujhe cahiye

bhuwanvats30,Didnt get refund!,BEWAKOOF APP IS TOTALLY FRAUD IN CASE OF RETURNING MONEY
nitinkumardeshmuk,Bewakoof,"So I bought a tshirt from bewakoof day before yesterday, basically in bewakoofs tshirt i liked the most is that the bewakoofs tshirt is having sarcastic quotes which looks good and funnier too. Overall the product is good as per its quality and design, also they have sent a small gift with the package, which is also the best thing because it makes me happy."
maahiskr1979,They Make Bewakoof to their customers every time,I purchased a lower from Bewakoof three times. Every time the price was higher from old order (for the same product).
avinashkrchintu,Product quality is worst,I have recently bought one jogger from this site and the quality is just got worsen after one wash itself and also the customer care is too pathetic to response.
anjalibharataurora,Payment refund,I hav been mailong bewakoof for months bt they not refunding my amount.  Keep saying they have sent it by Paytm when i dont use paytm.  ????????
eeone7,WORST E-COMMERCE WEBSITE EVER,"I still wonder how this company has survived all these years when it doesn't care about it's customers even a bit and they are ZERO on customer service, delivery timelines and reliability. I ordered a Tshirt and it was obviously delayed by the courier company which is nothing new on bewakoof's part. When I wrote to their customer care, they never responded back. I sent them several emails but they did not care to respond to one email. They didn't even bother to follow up with the courier boy when I told them I was unable to get in touch with him and today I saw my message that my order has been automatically cancelled. You are better off buying from Amazon instead of this shitty company!"
abhirex786,Galaxy blue fleece zipper hoodie review,"Bought it from bewakoof and i loved it , this is a genuine review its t shirt have been always good but i had never tried jackets, so was in a bit confusion while ordering but since the jacket seemed very nice and exactly the type i wanted so i ordered and its really very very good, yes one thing i marked is i ordered small but still it's a bit loose(not very loose), overall i love the product and you all should go for it, thumbs up from me"
Bikash887,Very Good Quality,I brought a t-shirt and the quality is very good.
sarfaraj9212,Very poor service,"Went on the phone cover yesterday from bewakoof, but they have such poor service during this pandemic. Courier Boy came to deliver the courier without wearing a mask which Can be very dangerous. Service is very irresponsible. Oder id 36577412"
koushik_smart,Pathetic Customer Service,The worst e-commerce site ever with no customer service support. You buy at your own risk. If lucky you might get the product but if not then just deal with it.
thakurneeraj14,Not good for loyal customers,I have made many purchases from bewakoof.com and have a membership also. i have made a purchase few weeks back and today the product is heavily discounted. I have asked for the store credit of the product price difference but they said cannot be done due to it being a regular practice of change in prices for ecommerce. Please see attached reply
jordandeo0,Classi Product  with Cool Desing...!,I had a very good shopping experience at Bewakoof.
jpooja,"Awesome Designs, Awesome Quality!!","I recently purchased a T-shirt Dress & a T-shirt from Bewakoof.com,  product received is the same as shown on the site & I loved it's quality too. I really find shopping at bewakoof worth as prices of their products are low & quality is good. You rarely get such brands to see. I think is a reliable brand & I love shopping from here."
nimmyks3,Nice experience,"I have ordered for a tshirt in Bewakoof for my brother, and it was really amazing, and I received on time, and clothes are too good. will buy again . Thank you."
mneelam16,Jet Black Fleece Zipper Hoodies,"Order Jet Black Fleece Zipper Hoodies, got in Rs.699/- only, good quality, just order 1 size big, fit me well, they given me little diary as gift. plz check length at the time of purchased."

shwetaag03,Bewakoof.com !! Bewakoof banane m kamyab,"Online Shopping: Buy Men, Women Fashion Clothes, Accessories - Bewakoof.com(https://Bewakoof.com) is actually proving their brand name and fooling people around. I bought few products but have to return some of them. They processed refund of the products not picked by them and vice-versa. After putting 8 reminders on e-mail(thanks to their operations team as they do not have any contact number) with no response. As a last resort, reported to Consumer forum. Even after that, they took 15 days to understand the issue and at the end shoved the refund amount in wallet. So yes, as per my experience, Online Shopping: Buy Men, Women Fashion Clothes, Accessories - Bewakoof.com(https://bewakoof.com) bewakoof banane m kamyab hua. Boycott Beware. Satarak rahe! Savdhan Rahe! Surakshit Rahe!"
sunil90narwade,Bewkoof is really bewkoof don't shopping on it.,Don't buy anything from bewkoof.com they are totally doing fraud business with there customer.I have order product and I wanted to exchange that product but they don't have customer care number and support also not responding on mail there curior boy also giving wrong feedback once you return the product and due to that I am unable to return my product.
vickyr1326,Bewakoof.com review,Bewakood I appreciate your unique design. infact I have purchased 3 t shirt. but after one  wash the color faded and t shirt got dull.
shankdharvaibhav5,Screwed up my first order,I ordered a back cover for my phone...  They sent me a totally different one which is for a completely different phone...  What is wrong with these people?
panwar863,Beware of this site.,Saw the ad of this site when I was on Facebook. It was in may 2019. I made an account to purchase a tee shirt but after reviewing decided not to buy from this site. Since then I have been getting messages on my phone as well my email id inspite of unsubscribing from the site and requesting them several times to delete my account  by mailing them since they do not have customer care number. At last in November I threatened them to go to court. They stopped for while and then again started sending messages on my email id. Really sick of this site.
truptilad09,Best experience with tiny complimentary gifts!!,A very good experience. I bought small backpack from them which is really good in quality. I got my product before 2 days of the delivery date. Also best part is on every parcel they send you some small gifts which is useful. This time I got a small notepad.
SimbaS,Waste of money?,"This shopping site is totally a scam. First of all they don't launch clothes in all sizes. For example a women shirt is available only in XS size and not in S, M , L and XL and after few minutes of launch it will show that the shirt is sold for all the sizes.  Also the delivery takes pretty long time as compare to other shopping sites. After so many mails they won't reply. And even if they answers they will give excuses mainly that they have warehouse issue saying they have huge demand which is totally an excuse not a reality. And if you force them they will ask you to cancle the order so that they won't have to reimburse you for their fault. The quality of their products is pathetic. Also their customer care service is worst. They don't have contact number. Their shipment and delivery is also horrible. Also their refund policy will give you headache. Not at all recommended."
jeevankemisetty,Order ID 31333170,Its been a month  I paid the money. Didn't receive the product. The customer service is providing bleak answers
buntynirman630,Online payments regarding,I place my order which is tshirt than my payment is online paid but the delivery boy say that your payment is not done .which is bad experience to bewakoof 9780080898
RatnanjaliMunnangi,Online shopping at Bewakoof.,"Bewakoof is an online shopping website for clothing, bags and  notebooks. The speciality here is the prints. The texts and the logos are printed on solid colour clothes."
dharshinime314,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,Guys please be aware before you book any products in it.
shelke.abhijeet,Poor customer service and poor T shirt quality,"Hi,"
g9862571700,Yallah haters,Too many bad reviews about this app.I think those who downvoted this app are kinda dumb smelly people who know nothing about clothing.Yes the delivery takes time but the product is always worth it.If anyone is seeing this dont really go on the bad reviews about these app.False rumours everywhere.
Exposer108,Poor Quality Clothes,"Hello Everyone,"
balafeb26,Worst service. No refund,Bought a t-shirt from Bewakoof.com one month back and it didn't get delivered on the expected time. It got returned its own and still I am waiting for my refund amount. Made many follow ups through email and no response from the team. They do not even have a customer support telephone number. What they have is a crap chatbox where it won't allow the customer to write their actual complaint instead it has some predefined queries where we have the option only to select from it. Never going to order from this site again. It is just a fraud website. Giving 1 star as there is no option to give 0 star.
shwetakataria86,Poor customer service,"Very slow customer service they have, they pick the product in"
TanumoyBanerjee,Nightmare delivery service,Ordered a cell phone cover 12 days ago but still no clue if the product is ever going to arrive. Luckily I chose to pay on delivery. Ridiculous platform with no customer support ever. Seems like a total fraud.
saikatmo63,Fraud app,"My name is Saikat Mondal , i have returned my parcel 6th September at the time of 12:56 courier's phone no is 8777871211. But i didn't got refund till now in my  wallet, my order id is 29586348. There is no contract no. I have already send mail 5 times but didn't got any reply from bewakoof app. So, This apps is totally fraud app ."

louisakshi12,Same faision tshirt,I'm waiting for long time that bewkoof bring new trend new pattern of t-shirt.
kaputt_lo,Don't want to badmouth their product...but,"I am usually aware of of the checkboxes which permit the site to send me messages and emails. I do not remember signing up for their news letters or offers but ever since I bought one of their cases, (which was decent) I am bombarded by their offer messages."
kumarshubhangi09,Bewakoof review,I have ordered 6 tshirt from Bewakoof and I'm really happy with the quality and colour .I think only drawback is the price of the product it should be reasonable.
chitraacharya44,Bewakoof,Pathetic. Rs 173 Bewakoof coins in the basket were removed without any pre intimation. Jaisa naam vaise hi baanaya. why give when you want to take it back.

jeenajacob0104,Pathetic service,I had ordered a one piece dress from this website. However when i din recieve the order within the given date i checked the app wherein it was showing as delivered. I wrote to the customer care people but nothing as been done about it even after 2 days has past.
p162_261,Bewakoof.com,"Guys as the name suggests, Bewakoof.com is making a fool of us.So do not shop from here and go for another site.An order of two t-shirts was placed from my side amounting to Rs.690/-.The payment was made by me with the help of debit card and charges resulted in deduction from my account.Neither I received my order as the product was out of stock nor I received my money back.On contacting customer care number, commitment resulted that you will receive within 48 hours which didn't happen.It is really a worst site which cannot be trusted at all."
nainapriya222,Worst App,"Last Month I had ordered 2 T-Shirts , & I thought within maximum of 15 days it will be delivered .

grwlvishal10,Product Bad And Very Late Delivery,Every product In t-shirt for Men in any Size The neck of the t-shirt is very small and quality too. Not Comfortable that why they are cheap. I suggest Redwolf.com. Good quality and better with the neck in the t-shirt.
araks40,Surprising Good,"Ordered two t-shirts for my son on this portal as a trial case not very confident on the quality. But I was pleasantly surprised to find one shirt delivered within 3 days (tho' I live in a non metro) and the shirt quality and logo is nothing to complain about, considering it was for 299 bucks. Not to speak of a gift in form of a small notebook."

mohanbabu89,Excellent product Quality & awesome collection,"Bewakoof is not at all like their name suggest, they are very intelligent with their creative work they shows on all their product, I bought almost 70% of their product and recommended to many friends because they actually provides pocket friendly products."
shikshajha5971,Worst experience ever,"This was the first time I was using bewkoof website for online shopping. And I have experienced the worst service .. Neither these guys have any contact number and the delievery executives number also that they provide is waste as they never pick up calls .. I got a message that my packet will be delivered today, I had given my office address so he was required to come before 7. On top of that when I tried connecting with them through their provided mail there response was not at all related to my query. Seems as they were just giving response for the sake of doing it.. Worst experience ever. Poor connectivity and customer support."
nishanegi2701,Great app if you need some cool stuff,This is one of the best app for casual dresses especially t-shirts for outings and such.

The colour, quality, and fit are exactly as explained in the description. I liked the colour and the material is soft and I simply don’t feel like removing it the whole day. Even after quite a few washes, it still looks as good as new. I recommend this site, especially for Gents T-shirt. I am glad I chose this product. The price it came for is nothing in comparison to its durability and comfort."

I just received the message that my product got delivered whereas I received nothing. I used their chat bot and locked complaint two days ago still no response.

abhijeetsamanta,Quality is not good,"I received a large size which I usually wear but it was big for me after alter this by tailor and after wearing 1 day its again got big means quality is too low and price damn high, and yes color also faded after two wash so wish you luck guys but I ll not buying any more."
suraj8458,Bewakoof.com,Heyy guys !

GSR007,Awesome hindi one liners,"Bewakoof.com is an indian online shopping website which has a variety of products for buyers like tshirts, shirts, boxers, joggers, pants and also printed covers. The quality of the products is good and the designs are cool too. The one liner printed on the tshirts are too attractive. I have ordered many tshirts as the price is affordable starting from just Rs. 249 - DESIGN OF THE DAY. The deliveries are made timely and even before expected time of delivery. The products are returned easily and the money is returned as soon as the product reaches back to the authorities."
daveschandani,:(,I have been shopping since quite some time.  But the latest delivery was a shock.  One of the reasons what makes bewakoof. Com different is the special gift along the shopping.  And what you sent me was a old rusted badge. How sad it is to see it.  Please be genuine with your stuff or dont gift anything at all.
avdhruva,Its all about presentation and focusing on quality,I have ordered 1st time T-shirt from Bewakoof.com
faizannabisahab11,Awesome online shopping app ..,"Whats up gys ? I started using bewakoof clothing app since 3 months from now and till now I am not disappointed with its service and quality of the clothes they offered and moreover the prices they offered are very affordable starting from 249 Rs only for the DESIGN OF THE DAY OFFER . so the NEW T SHIRTS they launch starts just from 249 RS and u get a cashback of 10 percent on every order . Many people said that there is a difference in color for what they see on mobile and what they get but I never faced this kind of issue from bewakoof . so , owing to all this reason , it became my favourite app for online shopping . absolutely loved the delivery policy as you can easily track  your order & get notified by SMS & email . moreover they have good refund policy also ."
ishutaak,Best and friendly shopping sites for teens,"Hello friends today I am writing my review on bewakoof.com so friends first of all bewakoof is  also a brand who makes his own clothes like t-shirt, shirt, sliders, caps for men and women so guys I am like a regular constumer of bewakoof I purchase I 9-10  tshirts from this website"
sameerbarbil,Best shopping app,"Hello friends, There is an e-commerce site launched in India named as bewakoof.com. Here you can able to order all types of dresses in best quality. In previous month, I used this app and order my new boxer pant. I like that pant. They provide best product at reasonable price. Their delivery is available all over country and delivery is very fast at low price. And here, your first delivery is free. The best thing is, you can earn cashback on every successful order and you can able to use it for further shopping. And they provide us a cool app with cool interface. I like it. Their customer service is really nice. So I suggest you all to use this app or website."
joshianshul15,T-shirts with good quality and great liners,I jave used this site quite a lot of times it have lots of trending clothings specially t-shirts with great liners. The cloth quality in superb in terms of comfortability. Also my order got delovered 2-3 days before the estimated date everytime. They have great offers which are available mostly everytime and the best part is there is always a offer on the new designs for the first day when they are uploaded so you can buy them at a cheaper price in the first 24 hours. Whenever I open this app I end up buying a thing or two.
mayankchh123,Late delivery,"As bewakoof.com is a online shopping of clothes website which has the t-shirt with funcy quotes written on it. Like MERI WALI ALAG HAI, SAB MOH MAYA HAI, DARU BAND KL SE, TERE JAISA YAAR KHAAN, etc. The funcy style is best but the delivery is so slow that it takes mostly 2 weeks to deliver the product. I am having my experience with bewakoof.com. I recently bought 2 t-shirts from bewakoof.com, too much time in packing that product. After 6 days, my product was packed. Rest bewakoof is the best indian website for shopping."
hiroto10,Good price,"I am using this app since last two months and I have ordered 7-8 products. They have good quality products. The best thing about this online clothing store is the price of it's products. Most of the products are cheap as compared to the market price. I loved their daily designs products, they are so good. Another best thing about this app is that it is so easy to return the item you have purchased."
abhi1222,They just want to make people BEWAKOOF,I purchased a phone case of worth 545 from bewakoof.com but as the name suggest it the site just there to make you a FOOL(bewakoof). When I received the product the quality of the case was worse than even a local vendor's shop. it looked like it was of around 50. the quality was pathetic and I decided to return it and asked for the refund which I made through my card and instead of refunding the money they transferred the amount in their wallet. I searched for other products to buy but the other things were really not good and were over priced. But after sometime I checked my wallet and guess what I found! your BEWAKOOF.com's wallet money is expired and your current balance is ZERO. So I just suggest you guys not to shop from here! Just go for any other site.=D
harshsin3,"Quirky Products, High On Style!",The products available on this website are just amazing! They are so trendy and cool. I've shopped from them so many times and I've always been complimented for them. The quality of products is amazing as well. The fabric and the prints are both of superior quality!
hrushikeshmande11,Some things about bewakoof.com,This is one of the top fastly growing sites in India. This website provides us varity of clothing and other accessories. They make their products themselves and also sold them. The qualoty is nice compairing to price. But they give us good choice options. So overall I think that bewakoof.com is good and gives us amezing shopping experience.
vickygangs904,Bewakoof review,"Bewakoof.com is a online shopping app. This app sell only t-shirt, slipper, bag etc. I want to share my experience with this app. I gave placed 5 orders on this app and satisfied with the product. But I want share the negative side of this app. The app did not have a good return policy and the cashback given system is so bad.1. Customer service: Bewakoof.com customer is so bad. they take 7 to 10 days to reply a email and the customer care didn't receive call2. Product quality: I have order 5 t-shirt and I am fully satisfied with the 100% pure cotton t-shirt.First t-shirt order id is 106945053. Delivery and timelins: Bewakoof.com take 5 to 10 days to make a delivery4. App and website: The app and website interface is not so good.they need some improvement.At last I recommend it to others because of good quality products"
ritikkedia47,Review,Bewakoof.com is a site offering you clothes at a very affordable prices with free jome delivery and we also get the opprtunity to return the item if we didnt like it so this site is totally awsome. I had ordred many graphic tshirts which is available only at 250 to 450 rupees the I loves the quality of product and the print quality the delivery is really fast they deliver the product with 5 days and there are many option for mode of payment but you will only get free delivery option when you do online payment .So after you are done with the payment they will also give you discount of 30 on your next product so its very cheap and affordable proce and the stuff is very good
sowmiya12,Please dont order anything here worst quality,Product quality is worst and it is delivered with broken state.
ankot1,Bewakoof.com poor quality,Hello friend I am Ankit.
Mohammedhisham666,Review,"Bewakoof.com is probably THE BEST online fashion website in India. It is very humorous as you can tell by the name, and it has great products as well. I haven't dealt with the customer service yet but I'm assuming they are going to be pretty supportive and helpful. Bewakoof.com is pretty different from any other online fashion websites or apps, they do things differently and they have great ideas. The website launches a new t-shirt design everyday at 6pm for 24 hours at the factory price. The collection is always great and humorous but it lacks one thing; Colours. When it comes to colours, bewakoof.com does not have a lot of options, only colors that would be available are White, Black, Blue and rarely Green. One more thing that the Bewakoof lacks is the delivery time. If you place an order you must expect it to be delivered by 10-12 days. Overall Bewakoof.com is just an amazing app and the team at bewakoof is really hardworking, hats off to them."
krishna1234334,Very good,Fabric is fine.but you should add more colourful t-shirts and normal t-shirts for girls rather than alone boy friend tshirts.i want a white t-shirt with colord   pizza drawing with caption.if u can make .i have already added picture of that tshirt.please try to make it
kingabhi2910,Poor product Quality,I would like to tell you my experience. I purchased a full sleve printed t-shirt. when the profuct was deliverd. It was not so appealing as it was on the website in case of fabric quality. It was not worth for me. I was not satishfied with this order on bewakoof.com
Thisisfake9,Product was satisfatory.,"Recently, I bought a product from this website, for the first time.  I had no idea about how their product or service would be before teying it myself."
yckarnik,Good idea something unique,"As I said, there are unique style of clothing in the website.Youngsters and teen agers would love to buy something but if we talk about price I thing it's quite expensive, they sell 1 ti-shirt for rs.250 at least rather than you will get ti-shirt for rs.150 from other site. But maybe you wouldn't get the unique stuff from the other side."
nirnaymouth,Good site for latest humor,Just the name is bevkoof But it won't make you friends.Really good experience.
akaaaashay,Osm Designs,"All designs of T-shirts are New and really a great stuff at reasonable price. Their gift service with every product is a good idea.There is one issue with delivery, Delivery of their products are very late. It must be resolved. Otherwise their services and quality of products are Very good ( bewakoof sale)"
kunalrathod172000,Terrible website,I ordered for tshirt of 249 rupees the delivery was dated for 6th March but the delivery was made on two days after ordering the tshirt were of large size than my expectations an there is limited variety for products they didn't even credited me with the amount to be credited as said by them totally dissappointed by is very bad website
gkaushik431,Bewakoof Fashion App,"Friends,"
anshulpanda10,Its a pathetic website,Hello friends
uhant84,Good quality t-shirt,"Pretty good app, delivery came earlier than expected print and clothing quality is also nice compared to the prices. Although tracking details are not available early you have to wait till the item is dispatched and you don't get the number of agent delivering the product"
herwiener,"Not So Good, Not So Bad.",Bewakoof.com is a good shopping website. It has great products at reasonable prices. It is very humorous as you can tell by the name of the website.however the quality of the products isnt that great and the time taken to deliver the products is long.overall the website and the app is very user friendly. The experience that I've had with the customer service is very nice and I do not have any problems with that so far.
Dpkgill7,Good Product delivery by Bewakoof,The item received fast as in time linmit of 4 days. The different shades of tees in different material available only on this website.

kordepgauri,"Horrible fitting , like local cloths","Bewakoof.com is popular website for casual cloths but fitting for cloths is horrible, I ordered casual T-shirt dress from here, It fitting is actually in square shape. now did I tell the company how the fitting should be for dress. Suggest not to buy from bewakoof if cloth fitting is also your concern"
vishnunaik813,Worst Service.,"Hello everyone, today I am going to share my review about Bewakoof.com which is a shopping site.I downloaded there application from play store.They gaved me 200 Rs discount for shopping firat time.I ordered a T-Shirt and one jeans.They told that it will be delivered within 7 days but you will not believe that they took 23 days to deliver just on T-shirt and jeans.When I tried to enquire about the delay.They didn't picked up my call.I was very disappointed with the service they provided.The delivery service disappointed me a lot.I will not recommend Bewakoof.com for shopping and their name is bewakoof they literally try to make you bewakoof."
unknown_thebest,Poor Quality Product,Bewakoof.com is Latest Online E-Commerce Website in India.
mishravikky68,Bewakoof.Com will not make you fool,"Bewakoof.com is a online shopping website which is known for high quality printing t-shirts, mobile cover, mugs, bags etc."
rahulvatsa33,About bewkoof,This is good app for buy funky material.  Funky goods like phone covers phone accessories.  But this is very costly app. Experience  is also not good with this app. The price of funcky tshirts is also so high and fabric of tshirts is also not soo good. So I think that this app is not good as comapre to mayntra and jabong.
hendrywatson99,Cloth Fabric Isn’t fine,"Bewakoof.com is all new E-Commerce website popular for FUNKY FASHION. They offer a variery of Clothing which includes T-Shirts, Shirts, Chinos, Joggers, Denims, etc."

chandalkhan,Worst app,Today I will review on Bewakoof. com
MRUD579,A QUALITY PRODUCT,I've ordered online a tshirt from Amazon.in of this brand calle BEWAKOOF .
sonalmishra089,Don't wast your time on bewakoof,"Hi all, I am ordered two item on bewakoof, the qualty I received you can't think, worst quality which u can get on footpath so never do order on bewakoof. I suffered so want to teel you guys be carefull all worlst products available on bewakoof."
avengarthiak,I'm sorry....,"Well, im really sory to say that I encounter with this webside. I thought that this webside really tried to help people, no they just post a good product but after order a fake product arive this is a fake dont stay too close to it they would only corupt your pocker you make them rich whil you grow porer .They did only for there self gain"
dhritirajs,Overpriced Products,"Bewakoof is a online clothing and accessories brand which mostly targets the youth population at large. You can find cool t-shirts, joggers, hoodies etc. Bewakoof.com is mostly famous for the Desi Slogan t-shirts. Overall quality of the products in bewakoof.com is great and you can blindly trust in the quality but the main problem that bewakoof has is that all the products in the website are priced slightly higher than its competitors which makes it a trouble for most of us. For example you can never get any tshirt below 500inr. Also the shipping services of bewakoof takes a lot of time to deliver it's products. I have ordered quite a few tshirts from bewakoof and every time the courier took more than 10 days to deliver the products. Most of us don't like waiting for very long and this could be a problem if you buy something from bewakoof. Otherwise bewakoof is a good option to buy if you can spend and wait."
rohitdhabre,Very late delivery.,"I ordered a moto g phone cover from beeakoof.com about a week ago from its application.But first it wasn't taking my order I don't know for what reason.But it had been 5-6 days me trying to order it, I could had easily ordered a cover from another site but I liked the cover which was on their website.Now it has been almost 5 days since my order was approved but I have received no messages or email about my order, when it is going to come or weather it has been approved or not!"
debabratajena,Very good site.,Bewakoof is very good online marketing site. All my friends are using  this side and also use its product . Product quality are too good . Its design are outstanding. It give very good service . In first time login it give 100 rupee . This site is user friendly. So keep shopping.
ypehlajani,Expensive products,"Today im here to tell my review on bewakoof.com this site is very expensive every single product is expensive I have ordered a iphone 6 case the quality of case was good but the price was 500 and after two days I saw that case of 200 and iwas shocked and checked other things on the site like jeans, t-shirt, other phone cases and everything was too expensive so from my opinion this site is too expensive you can check the things on any other sites"
surajb01,Expressive & innovative t-shirt,"Hi, Bewkoof is one of my favorite shopping sites to buy t-shirts. I bought almost 10 to 15 t-shirt this year and I am very satisfied with the quality and print of the t-shirts."
Rshk93,Very high priced products on bewakoof.com,"Hi,"
amey2202,Pathetic service...!,"Hello friends, I would like to share my experience and opinion about the online shopping website which is BEWAKOOF.COM. I ordered a T-shirt from their mobile application which is available on playstore and app store. They treated me with a discount of 100 rupees which is a very nice thing but no one will believe that it took more than 20 days just to delivery one T-shirt. I called up and asked them that I haven't received my Order yet, and also have them a feedback about that. It literally to more than 20 days to deliver the Tshirt, they literally ignored my order. I'll attach the screenshot with this review. Please check the screenshot as it is clearly shown that I place the order on 9th of October and I received the order on 1st of November. The service of Bewakoof.com is very nice, they reply very quickly but the delivery man annoyed me a lot."
009arpan,Bewakoof.com,Bewakoof.com is a website as well as an App for making purchases online for clothes.
ashishrajabanshi,Not reliable online site...,"Hii guys this is Ashish and I am going to give the review on bewakoof.com from my personal experience. Bewakoof.com is a online website where you can buy clothing and accessories from this website. I wanted to buy a snapback cap for me. I went to bewakoof.com and looking for it. There was many types of snapback caps on the website. They all are looking very attractive. So I oredered a berlin snapback cap for 499. Though the website is too slow to loading. The app is much faster than the website. Its delivery was ontime. It gave me the time for delivery was 8 days. But I received it on 7th day. When I opened the package there was the cap. But it's quality is very poor. It was very bad experience from this website. So I prefer to go for popular online sites such as Flipkart, Amazon and not to go for bewakoof.com. Thank you"
Pradhyumn12,OUT OF COLLECTION !!!!,"Most of the times you will not see anything new on this app to purchase . They are selling there old printed shirts and earning for that only, nothing new from last 1 year . Also the Delievery is too slow compared to other websites, they take almost 10 -12 days to Deliever a product and for that also they will charge 25 - 50 Rs Delievery charges . I would never Recommend this site to anyone for online shopping . There are better options available in the market ."
Viber_kida,Exactly Bewakoof,Hey guys I'm going to giving review about bewakoof.com.This is a online shopping site or app .Here we get variety of products on this site. Customer service from bewkoof is slower and not much responsive as I experience on faulty product. I bought a redmi 3s prime back cover in it which cost me nearly 450 rupees ( a huge price for just a cover) . It was advertised very attractive when I watched it on bewakoof.com while purchasing it. There were lots of attractive covers on it. But after purchasing it when it delivered to me it was of cheaper quality. So product quality I found is very bad. Here they delivers us a product within 7 days which is not bad .The cover I purchased on it was delivered in 6 days .app is fast and conformable than site as site takes too much time for loading. Reliability is something like false and personally I don't liked it. So I recommend you to go for other sites which are popular like flipkart and Amazon rather than this bewakoof.com site. Thank you guys.
satnamd75,Bewakoof.com,"The above thing is cheap, I would like to suggest one thing to bewakoof dealers.Your third party delivery service named ""Delhivery"" is the worst courier service I have ever seen.Stop delivering your products using this delhivery courier service., Worst service for delivery and product. worst service for delivery and product. worst service for delivery and product. it was canceled after citing some issues with courier. They have shared a courier tracking number, which never showed any result in Courier site. but they claimed it was shipped and returned by courier. orst service for delivery and product.  It is a very good website, and it is cheaper on the market,"
hadwani261,Bewakoof Shopping app Review !!,"Hello Guys ! Today I am going to share my experience of Bewakoof.com with you people. I think that would be a good choice rather than reviewing it so, basically I will do a little review"
tarun3400066,Worst one,As the name said it is really like one of the bewakoof website available in the present market many problem I have faced while ordering in this site like complicated inner site while entering into site and very long reaction time from their customer care services and also more delivery time sometimes we did no get what we ordered from this site so be aware of this fraud sjtes and better to be in safeside
fantastic111,Bewakoof one of my fav,I love this site because I am type of a boy who loves to be in trending world and bewakoof provides awesome trending outfits I even gifted my girlfriend a crop top which was super cool I loved it my first item which I buyed was a jogger with a white strip below the right kner and a black tee shirt whith strip on the arms and I am still wearing it cause I like it a lot
mukesh_1991,Large Variety of Clothes,Large collection of clothes for youngsters with unique style. AIso they have latest trend T-shirts like cartoons. I recently purchased T-shirt from it. They delivered my T-shirt in 3 days. Top quality product!. I highly recommend this site for shopping.
aneeshkumar258,BEWAKOOF.com,So bewakoof is a online stylish clothing store .I have been shopping from this store scine a year now and I have no complaints regarding it.
razatanveer17,TOO EXPENSIVE !!,"Bewakoof.com is another online shopping website with good variety of products for youth like Clothing, Back covers , bags etc Products look very good on the screen and quality of goods also seem to be good. But quite frankly quality if we look at the high price of the goods thier quality is not as convincing and Reliable as expected. In simple words, They charge very high prices than they should charge on the products they deal in."
Silas77,Not reliable.,"Friends! Have bought a goods or any kind of stuffs from this website? Cause, I haved and I would write a review on this website and the product out of my own experience for your awareness. It was just last thursday when I received my first product using this website. I had bought a pair of sport shoe, and you know what the the quality was damn fake. It looks beautiful but, I regret buying it. The customer service is also improper and slow in responding. Also delivery is so late. This website is so unreliable."
Adios,Trendy and quality products,The first thing I bought  from bewakoof was a T shirt.I bought it 3 years ago and Its still in the same condition. No fading yet and I dont think it will ever fade.
Sandeshkmr,Unaffordable prices,"Bewakoof has got some really appealing products, whether it is the catchy one-liners or the stylish prints. Four months back I ordered the joggers from it, initially I wondered about the quality of the fabric, but after using it found it comfortable enough and it has got the right fitting for me. I received the order within 3 days. I am happy with the product and i'm satisfied with its delivery service too. But when it comes to prices than they are generally on the higher side. Apart from high prices the variety of products is not too wide. I usually prefer not buy my cloths from bewakoof.com due to overpricing plus additional shipping charges and limited range of products when compared to other online shopping stores. One more thing which I need to mention, I got to know from my friends about its customer care services are not responsive. I feel that one should use this site atleast once due to its unique style, but cannot be used in long run. I would only prefer to shop from bewakoof only when the prices are lowered."
Sanjay25398,Good,"Name is catchy n the stuff too. You can find some good funky trousers, t shirts, phone cases etc. There is A wide range of printed stuff. Although the stuff is good but price is A bit high. People would prefer more if price was A little less. I bought A phone case which was 3d printed, it has been 1 year to the case n it is still working good. I would prefer you all to try this Site if you are looking for something really funky n good quality n if price is no isse for you."
hmehra18,As the name suggests this is an unreliable company,"Bewakoof.com is an online marketplace where people can shop from the comfort of their home. The company has an unusual name that caught my attention and I thought to use their services. This company mainly deals in clothing and provides a range of clothes for Men, Women & Kids. Apart from clothing users can also buy accessories such as mobile accessories, bags etc. They work as a channel between sellers and buyers and provide a platform to make the buying process easy and convenient. They provide a choice to the customer to choose a product as per their desired size, color, pattern and price."

krishyellu,First Catchy after shopping appropriat title to me,"Hi guys, really for the first time I got really a bad experience with an online shopping site.  In this busy life this online shopping really made my life easy as far as shopping is concerned, it's so easy to buy any product through online as we can select anything according to our requirement while resting at home. Comming to my recent experience with Bewakoof.com its so worst that I ordered few t shirts for me im which out of 5  I got 3 defective pieces so opted for exchange option for 2 weeks there is no respond from them as there is no visit of any executive to take back the pack as we can contact them only through mail after so many mails they responded stating that they never got any mail or complaint before this mail. I was so disappointed with their service and at the end after 17 days I got my pack exchanged but this time I got top wear but not of male, I bursted very badly on courier guy who said by mistake he delivered to a wrong address."

honeymarryme,Limited Stock,Just not giving a wide range of variety of products in fashion or bags.
adityapunkstar11,Yes they are making us bewakoof,I orderd this tshirt from bewakoof.com and paid 600 around for the delivery. There is some exictment when the delievery comes and you open your ordered thing.First of all the delivery was a day late even you pay the charge and after opening the package my mood was to just tear the tshirt. Then I thought why to waste money I wear it one time and then the next time I washed it was so loose like you inflate a balloon. God knows what kind of cotton shirt was it & the product quality is too bad. It feels like you pay for it and wear it for one time.

786Devil786,CHEAP QUALITY PRODUCTS,Hello. the name of the site is bewakoof.com express itself. Well I had ordered a t shirt of fullsleeves just 2 months ago. N the tshirt is text printed. Its take 1 n half week to dilever the product n after using it I experience that the printing is disappering n the colour is getting dull so obviously the quality was very cheap. I would never recommend people to shop from this site.
ashishverma9650,Poor catalogue and product quality,"Hello friends I have ordered a set of formals from bewakoof.com and 2 jeans I am not at all happy with my order, their product catalogue was very less there was no popular brand for jeans like Levis and Wrangler so I don't think they can lure good customers."

spsingh99,Bewakoof.com a paradox,"Bewakoof.com a online shopping website, which offers its products with jingles, tags line, some cool unique trendy clothing, mobile covers, and many more. I have purchased a hoody jacket and a T - shirt the quality was very good as well as fabric was good. There are many products on the websiter with different styles the price on website is a bit high but you can buy when it comes in your budget but trust me the products are worth purchasing it because are of good quality. Dilevery is slow as compared to Flipkart and Amazon. But overall it is reliable."

I recently ordered tshirt from this website but after using it for first time and when I washed it in washing machine the colour of tshirt get fade. I asked customer care regarding this problem but they have no answers for this kind of problems.

aditya3011,A RELIABLE STORE,I ordered a T shirt and a cover for my iPhone 7 plus delivery was great. got the package within two days quality of the cover was absolutely fantastic and T shirt was not too good the cotton was truly bad and started tearing within 45 days of purchase. Although it's a great store to buy covers for your mobile customer service is excellent and delivery is brilliant. That's all my true experience that I have shared with you friends thanks for reading.
alexsajan18,Variety products,"Bewakoof.com has a small selection of variety design t shirts. I downloaded this app only because of that reason. We can also earn from each purchase. These earings can be combined to buy another item. Eventhough it is nothing to other big online sites, the things it contain are rare and are really attractive."
hiteshkhanna,Bewakoof.com,Hello guys today I am going to review online shopping website bewakoof.com which is mainly famous for its different printed things like tshirts and mobile covers. I had ordered mobile cover for my mobile at rs 499. But I want to say that the product quality was very cheap and the printed pattern disappears just after 2 months of use. Also they took around 2 weeks to deliever the product which is a very long time.
malukaniricha9,True opinion,"I had bewakoof app in my phone I ordered a track suit recently through it the pictures shown in this are completely diffrent and, what I recived was different. The quality of cloth is low and not durable. I really did not like the product. It was like, thin cloth I dont know why I recived this. I will never order from this"
mandalsoumyajit07,Amazing Website for Buying Clothes,First let me tell you.Bewakoof.com is all about style!
ankit2252,Making bewakoof of public,"This is just like politician, making bewakoof of public. Products are totally different from from what what you ordered online and return process is like winning a war. Quality of product is worse and even not properly packed when you recieve the item. App and website are just too bad to use, slow and irritating. customer support is another milestone by bewakoof as no ine respond to your problems even if tgey do then its another problem as their response is very rude. delivery is never on time, bewakoof is not reliable at all."
harshadhiyol,Worst site,First of all this site selling mostly fake products.
landofaccessories,Trending Stuff,This is a website where you get stuff for youth wear mostly. The customer service is decent yes they can improve it a little but overall no issues with it.
ratiranjanpanda10,Bewakoof.com,I ordered 2 tshirts on bewakoof  that doesn't look good but in the app it looks quite good customer service on bewakoof.com is very poor u can't even contact the customer care service product quality is not same as shown on internet delivery time very poor it tooks 8 days  to get a delivery and the android app of bewakoof.com is very poor it lags a lot and requires and uses haeavy data so overally it's not realiable.
rohitkawle810,Bewakoof.com | Best Product,"Bewakoof.com  best website for buy mobile back covers, shorts, boxers, track pant etc. I am buy back cover for my redmi 3s and use for 5-6 month it is so strong and nice in quality .

mascarenhasallen5,Overall great service!!,"Bewakoof.com is a good online website for shopping.I bought a light blue denim jogger from the website whichs costs rs.1699.The quality of the product is upto the mark.It is woth the money spent.The product arrived within 5 days of ordering.It is actually before the given time which shows that bewakoof has a good delivery service.The jogger was same as shown in the picture.The website is also properly organized.It did not take me much time to search for the product that I wanted.Overall the quality of the product is good, size is proper and it is a reliable and trusted website for shopping online.I recommend everyone to shop from bewakoof.com."
ronladdsouza,Bewakoof,"Bewakoof.com is really making us bewakoof by their fake site, initially I did not had any idea to purchase anything from this site but their advertisements on facebook pages were really attracted as wan make our own design on the dress we want to buy, but the quality of dress materials are really very pathetic and the product I ordered I could not use it for more then twice the dress was costly and was not at all worth for buying really a pathetic fake site"
Ankit6464awasthi,Waste of money,Hello everyone my name is Ankit awasthi. and I am going to tell you about bewakuf.com. seriously it is just like it's name. Bewakuf.com it worst site. When I go on this site I was looking for jeans. And I have spend too much time on this site and finally I like two jaens. so I orderd that. Seriously it was too much irritating they took too much time to deliver that jaeans. as I was so excited  to see my jeans. And after soo many days when they deliver jeans I saw them it was totally looking different from they show on site. thats quality was worst.  I hate this site. It is worst site. And seriously it was my full to waste of time and ya waste of money too. So I will never suggest this site to anyone.
dumbo7,Bewakoof.com,"When I at first opened bewakoof.com, I examined this site for around 30 minutes, they have bundles of shirt with astonishing quotes. I checked each and every quote and shirt. I was hunting down some hunk or practice focus sort shirts. Finally I found few and I asked for them.  Their transport organization is totally not all that awful they passed on me the things in 6 days. When I opened the package, I felt awesome in light of the way that shirt were absolutely same which I asked for and quality was in like manner mind boggling. I have managers them around 4 months back and shirts are still as it is by all accounts, there."
jayagauri90,Make a fool out of people,"Bewkoof.com is not at all a good and a satifactory online site for shopping . The first time I opened the site, I was amazed seeing the different and  new prints on the t shirts and I decided to order two of them for rupees 1000 . My excitement had already finished when they took so long to deliver it to me which was 15 days, approximately 2 weeks . Whenever I tried to reach them through call or e mail, they never responded and even if they did, it was too late and always making excuses. I could ignore all this but then when the package reached me and I unpacked it, I was shocked to see the misprinting on the t shirts and the bad quality of the t shirts. I also tried to ask them for refund but again no response so instead I thought that I could wear them as my night suit thats it . I had the worst experience with this web site."
charles32,Worst products sold online,This site dispatches very low quality printed poducts. I had ordered 5 t-shirts from this site and they arrived within the estimated time so I was very happy to see them. But the moment I unpacked all the boxes all of my enthusiasm was lost. Two out of those 5 t-shirts had fault in its print. The other three thirts also were very different than the ones I had seen on the site. They had a poor quality of cloth used for it. I had all of my t-shirts returned and fought for the refund in my bank account. I'm never ordering any of the items sold my bewakoof.com
Narendraprasad,Do not use it for Clothing.,Bewakoof.com is worse online website for buying anything because I had bad experience from it I once ordered I mobile phone back cover from it in around Rs. 500 with shipping charge and it took three weeks to reached over to me and when I tried to contact them through email and through they always made excuses that it will take time our server is slow and all . And when I got it seriously it does not seem to be like Rs. 500 back cover it like RS.300 - Rs. 250 totally do not worth it . And their customer support is also very bad they do not have any good answer to any question they simply tried to make excuses to the customer . And when I tried to review it then I come to know that they does not show customer review on their website that totally bad I mean they had put lot of brain in making this website so that people does not come to know about the bad thing they are selling in high price tag. I would not recommend this website to anyone.
vvk_thakur,Its Real bewakoof.com,"I wants to tell you guys, bewakoof.com needs to provides good faclities but bewakoof.com failed"
rohitchanchal007,Making people Bewakoof as it is named after .,Bewakoof.com is making people bewakoof as it is named after I am saying this because I had a bad experience with it . Actually I have ordered two product from this website one was mobile phone back cover and another was one lower . And I find out that this website is actually only good at mobile phone back cover  because when I placed ordered it was of Rs. 900 and it's actually price was Rs. 1200 but I bought it on sale so when I wore this lower for two to three time then problem came to star like the elastic quality of the lower was very bad one at the waist and also with bottom of the lower near ankle because after two to three wash it elastic at bottom end of lower near ankle get lose and stitching quality was also not that good as compared to the price I have paid like the elastic near waist get stcked with robe which was given for the fashion statement the elastic and robe always get stucked and get twisted with each other and one can feel the twisting of elastic and robe while wearing it and after washing many time it threats are also getting visible as it is cheaper one like of RS. 500 and the fabric was good but after wash it it getting a bit of annoying like it it getting tighter at some point. I would recommend this website only to those people who only want to buy mobile phone back cover they are of good quality and one can get every design for every mobile phone but not for clothing and delivering time is also very slow like it take two week atleast to get product delivered it was same with the mobile case and same with the lower I would not recommend this website to anyone for clothing if you like my review do like and write comment .
mayanksogani96,Swendler and big fraud,"Today I am sharing my bad experience with this website , I see many adverts of this it have diffetent collection of clothes and shoes which you never saw , I visit website and see many t shirts with good thoughts there is offer buy 3 at 999 .so I order three with my size after payment it show it delivered within 2 week . But it delivered very late around 3 week , after I receive my order .the packaging is so different and there is dobut in my mind that is there something wrong and when I open packet it appear truth.there is only single tshirt .i complain them they say me we sent a pair of three , so it is not our fault you receive single product .now I understand whole that they fool me and prove that they made bewakoof to their consumer .now very disappointed why I buy from this website."

rishabjolly,Bewakoof online shopping,This Bewakoof.com online shopping site is not a good site for the shooping. I ordered many times from this site but always facing following problems.
rhyno,Bewakoof.com,".Bewakoof.com is a form site which was offering garments however now they offers telephone covers too. The items are truly appealing to youths like understudies.  The User interface is great not a lot to say in regards to that now coming to value I would state that estimating is tiny bit higher than it ought to be, everything on this site is really overrated by me. The items which is appeared on site is same we get when purchasing yet the main thing the items are minimal overrated .I.e., we get much quality item at same cost. I recommend wesites like myntra, amazon, jabong because of this."
dkdinesh357,Unique site,Bewakoof.com is quite different site as compared to the other sites.
rjnhot,High prices and less products,I don't seem Bewakoof.com that useful or nice as the other online shopping applications are their. Because they don't have quantity in products and even the quality they provide is average and the prices are not worth. They are extraordinarily high as compared to their competitors though they provide good quality in affordable prices. App is good looking but it doesn't show what we are trying to search most the time. Delivery time is late and I don't know about the customer service because I didn't had a word with them yet and I think it won't be needed because I am not not gonna use it again.
robhin007,Bewakoof.com,Bewakoof is really good. The loading time is a bit more than expected. I'd like the Search to be better by the next . And the clothing quality is up there with the big brands. Good job you guys.

sohelshekh786,Not good online store,"Bewakoof.Com has a flowery name and really fancy cool searching collection. Telephone cases Ordered 2 cases for my mother and myself. Both very reasonably-priced fine plastic and broke the very first time it fall on the floor. The charge of Rs 350+ delivery charges is exorbitant for this satisfactory. Leggings The leggings had been presupposed to be becoming or little bendy, rather it became a pajama match. I'm now wearing them at home for mattress time. T-Shirts Hosiery stuff which you find at your neighborhood flea markets. If you want to pay excessive for those caricature t-shirts. You can like them, then."

I bought my galaxy s5 phone back cover from here and I 'm totaly satisfy with the price, product quality, and delivery time. Its main focus is on designing the products accoding to the trend suitable for Young Indians. My classmates used to shop clothing appliances and accesories from here , and find all products all good."

iambakarwi,Worst delivery service,"Regarding order # 4531065 and 4640261. Regarding first order it was one plus 3 case which was of used quality and also scratches can be seen which was also not fitting in to my mobile. So I returned it vat and cod charges were not refunded to me also worst part is the delivery person is really uneducated and uncultured.The way they are behaving is very cheap and that was actually expected from a start up with no proper future. Now comes to second order, actually I did not get a single chance to see my product because the delivery agents did not call before coming also ad mentioned earlier in my review that these agents are very unprofessional they use to say teko ana hai to aa nai to main order cancel karta hun and ultimately as said my the owner of Bewakoof said my order was cancelled, not only this vat and other charges were not refunded Around 350 rs is in my Bewakoof wallet and I can only shop with it at Bewakoof only as their refund policy is like that only .MAY GOD BLESS THESE PEOPLE."
xudip,Live life like bewakoof :P,"Bewakoof has been active since a long time. When bewakoof first came out, it had some really cool stuffs which were moderately priced. The quantity in category was less despite  being a startup but they really made some cool t-shirts with some funky quotes or designs. With time they have indulged into selling denims, joggers, hoodies, boxers, pyjamas, etc. I have noticed a few pyjamas & hoodies bearing the same design it had 2 years back which I personally didn't like. With time one needs to evolve & not just changing the website's UI & putting an app in playstore, I meant changing the stuffs that they were selling an year back & welcoming new designers with some more creative ideas. The denims & joggers are over priced. The only thing I like now about bewakoof is their Boxers section. All the boxers are reasonably priced at Rs. 245/- compared to flipkart or souled store where the same thing is priced at above Rs. 350. I have recently ordered a boxer & a mobile cover from bewakoof. The boxer was delivered pretty fast within 3 days through fedex courier service. The mobile cover hasn't been dispatched yet. I have mailed my concern twice since it's already prepaid. Hope they will do it in time."

They don’t deliver purchased product.no time limit.no response to emails.there is customer .very poor pathetic service. Inspite of so many reminders no budy care about you. There are also rumours that it can be a pathetic apps and website which is not good at all.it will continuously irritate you in their website and the quality of the product is less in quantity. Thank You

vivekbagdai,Products are good but delivery service verybad,"I order on Bewakoof.com 3-4 times but all the times they say delivery time  2-4 days, and non of the product deliver on time. and Its not like I order from some small town where delivery may take time, but this guys only have good items not good  service."
Das_Rajesh,Reggae collection is incredible,"I am a hippy by heart. I usually buy my clothes from Goa because that’s the ultimate place to get Reggae stuff. I am a huge Rasta follower and keep hunting for hippie clothes, shades, accessories etc. I was surprised to see Bewakoof.com’s Reggae collection! There’s a wide range of Reggae Tshirts, vests and joggers collection with them. They’ve always had the funny and creative things printed on their tshirts and joggers, which already has made them stand out. I had ordered 2 joggers from Bewakoof.com earlier and I love it’s quality and style. Now I’ve ordered 2 tshirts and 1 vest from the Reggae Collection. Hoping that it arrives soon!"

Ashish_Jadhav,The product quality is unbeatable,"Often funky t-shirts and pyjamas are assumed to be low quality product. But Bewakoof has provided both quality and cool humor t-shirts. I feel the delivery is slow is received my products after 8 days of order placement. But its worth the wait. The t-shirts are comfortable and print is good too. The designs are impressive. I got myself a T-shirt and a pyjama, I even uploaded pictures on the website wearing these and my photo got featured on the Fanbook. They have amazing games and contests on social mediam, I find it very exciting to be associated to this brand as a customer. It really defines youth."
Saurav_k,Value for money,"I have always been a wearer of tees with bold statements. I used to do most of my shoping from the famous street markets in Mumbai. So you can imagine my delight when I discovered a site like Bewakoof.com! Not only do I get t-shirts with very original content but at amost the same price as charged by the street vendors. I don't mind paying the extra 50 bucks or so for the premium quality of fabric that they use. Now I regularly buy all my clothes from sites like Bewakoof, Inkfruit and Redwolf. I believe the extra premium charged by these sites are worth the money as we get the products home delivered, the quality of the clothes is much better and the level of creativity is unmatched. So kudos to all these ecommerce companies for making our shopping so much simpler!"
adigada3,Batman and Superman Collection are a hit!,I have always been a mad anime fan. So I was so glad when I saw Bewakoof's Batman and Superman Collection. Their designs are cool and simple at the same time. I especially like their pajamas and boxers with all over prints. Their products are super comfortable. I was happy to find the same print available in so many color combinations. I even picked up a Flash tee which is a big deal since it is not very commonly found. Now my entire wardrobe is full of superhero cloths all thanks to Bewakoof. It was quite saddening though at times when some of the products chosen by me were not available in stock. I hope they come out with more product lines for a lot of other anime characters!
mravijitda,Bewakoof Latest Fashion,"I was not much aware from Bewkoof.com, I have seen many advertisement on net of Bewkoof.com, like with some of funny phrase or few very meaningful phrase written on the T-shirt. Once my cousin told me this site is real, and there is huge collection of T-shirt for both boy and girls.I have ordered quite a few items from bewakoof.com. As the name sounds, the website is completely opposite. They have amazing and very cute and innovative designs which have stolen my heart. I've bought a mobile case, few t-shirts and few mugs as well."

anujtanwar1234,Expensive with poor quality products....,I bought boxer( GHANTA ) 2 months back and they charges 400 rupee for that which is very expensive and around 2 months of use it expands from medium size to large size and the print of the boxer is vanished and now boxer look like simple boxer.
solitudelad,Poor quality clothes,After going through their websited I liked couple of t shirts with some cool prints but I was doubtfull whether to order or not as clothes are not from any brand and I felt like they are manufactured by some local brand. But after thinking I ordered couple of t shirts from bewakoof.com but it turned out to be a bewakoof decision aprat from some cool prints its not worthy at all as their clothes are not comfortable and are manufactured by some street factory. I sincerely advise don't expect any brand clothing or comfort its just prints which are fascinating else it was waste of money for me.
gudsness,Bad an terrible,This is a very bad website no direction nothing. Very user friendly tho. This website has absolutely rubbish costumer service where the typically reply in NEVER. This website has good cases tho they fit too tight that my edged phone is becoming curved. The print on the back is low quality and 1 of my cases the print started fading away. Just hope nothing goes wrong with your experiences during the payment as they never reply so if you lose money it will never come back to you!

Along with that, there are no extra charges for the same. It is a great E-Commerce website in today’s time. I have had a good experience in getting back the exchanged product as well. The delivery is on time; even the delivery agents are very polite."
vivek647,I loved that hoodie.....,"After searching a lot for a nice and comfortable hooded vest, I stumbled upon Bewakoof’s website. This is my first experience of shopping from this online store. Firstly, I thought of trying the collection of hooded vests for various reasons. Getting the quality correct was one of the biggest concerns for me. As I work out regularly and having such a vest could be of immense help, I ordered two of them from Bewakoof. The quality has come out to be nice and as expected. There are no complaints regarding that. Additionally, I have got a discount on both the products individually as I enrolled myself in the Tribe Membership program. I have got both the vests from a brand named Fugazee, which has a decent collection of men’s clothing. I would recommend you guys to purchase vests from Bewakoof. Can’t wait to shop more and share my experience with you guys."

Sid_Sharma,Quirky Designs! Great Quality!,"I've been ordering from bewakoof.com for a very long time now,  the quality of their products is amazing! Their joggers are one of the most comfortable ever! Their T-shirts are amazing, great for college going crowd, good quality at very affordable prices. Been a fan, always will be."
NikiShah88,Love their joggers!,"I am a person who loves roaming in comfortable clothes. I prefer wearing loose track pants and tshirts over a pair of denims and a girly top as it makes me feel more comfortable which is very important for me. This is mainly because I travel a lot to my college from my place and I have many projects for which I have to move to places. When I came across Bewakoof.com, I absolutely loved their joggers for women. I wanted to buy 3-4 joggers all together at a time. They look fabulous and trendy but I feel it’s a bit over priced. I am still a student and I don’t earn. All I get is some amount of pocket money of Rs.7, 000 per month so I cannot spend Rs. 1, 200 on only one pair of joggers. As joggers are to be worn as a casual wear so it shouldn't cost this much. I hope they reduce their joggers' price. If they do so, I will surely buy a lot of it!"
