priyamehra1331,Best Shopping App,I purchased T-shirts and cargos from this website. the fabric quality was amazing. Just loved their collection.
ashishjadhav67,Pathetic delivery service and communication,I ordered 3 t shirts on 20th June 2022 and on 22nd June my order delivery status shown as out for delivery which we expect to get delivery by that day itself. But this is the first time I experienced this problem souled store that they show the status of out for delivery but later on its not the case and it happened 2 consecutive days. I tried to communicate with their delivery partner as well but no response. Very horrible experience I got and never expected this from Souled store where before this I purchased several t shirts.
amit81288,Very pathetic,Can't explain in words. They should change there name to idiotic store.
Akash8186,Worst,"Their wwe merchandise department is far from authentic, look at the letters, it's very small and definitely not as same as what they sell in wweshop. Please refrain from buying anything from them"
clint_azavedo,Sad Souls,I ordered for 2 t-shirts worth Rs750 and with much delay not finding the address the delivery guy wasted my day. Now when I see only 1 shirt I received and it was in really bad condition.
chrismathalikunnel,Tricked,I have never been more inconvenienced by online shopping. These people tricked me with their 30% discount by showing me the amount with discount till I made the payment and then realising that they overcharged me! The amount that got deducted from my card did not include the discount. I feel cheated and scammed. I tried to contact them to fix this issue for days and still there has been no improvement. They should have refunded the extra money but instead they offered to give me some lousy reward points. Why should I accept the reward points if don't want to do any future transactions with them? And also I have not yet received those reward points in my account.
yadavmarketing,Tshirt,Pathetic stuff ...high price I ordered online ..no return pickup facilities. I am very fed up with your services and quality.
pikeshpatel492,Good products bad return policy and refunds.,"Ordered t-shirt from the souled store but the quality was very poor and size was also not fitting so I tried to return the product but they didn't arrange any return courier, as they won't refund your amount on your bank account instead they refund on their account's wallet."
vedashreeyuvaraj,Worst.,The material of the cloth is toooo thin and the cost is high. And when trying to return the product we need to send the product through courier and the process is too much . I would not recommend anyone buy products from here . Guys please make things convinent and easy so that we can buy more things
sam14ajmani,For souled store,"The collection is very beautiful but the there is always some issue with the payment both shopping experiences were very bad the first time payment was made but shown as not excepted the second time also the same issue payment deducted from account but not accepted shown on the website now my money is blocked and it's just too much stress and hastle please do something about your servers , or payment receiving systems it's really bad"
mohit2704,The SOILED Store.,"I recently bought some 3 t-shirts from the souled store, the size of the t-shirts was not proper hence I applied for a return/refund request. First they did not have an arrangement to pick up the t-shirts when escalated they arranged for someone to pick up the tshirts and approved my refund request, I have been fighting for my refund since then. Its been close to a month, I have sent them numerous e-mails, made infinite calls to their customer care, I still have not received the refund from them. I had no idea these guys were so cheap that they would block my Rs 1197 for I dont know what reason. I am surely not making any purchases henceforth from them and would never recommend them to anybody going forward."
jaksh143,Shittiest Service,"For the question of did you like the product. there is no answer because the product was never delivered. Its been more than 5 days  and the souled store mailed me that the product is been delivered whereas, it was never received at my end. Now there is a delay just to get an update from their side regarding this mess. Its been 5 days I have been waiting for an update about where is my product if it is not delivered then."
nitishrana100,Products,Well.On Website it looked really well and big but after receiving an order it was not up to the mark or to the quality expected as per the price. Seemed Less than Average. Dissatisfied. Will advice others not to go for it as it not doing Justice. For Company my advice is that they should change the quality.Their Ideas are brilliant but products are badly to be changed to the better better quality
Dexter999,Average Products,"I wanted by some T-shirts of my favourite TV series characters or superheroes. But I was not finding a particular store for it but then I came to know about souled store from google. There were many Superheroes merchandise like bags, T-shirts, Sweatshirts, Mugs, etc. But they were a bit expensive for such items. But I wanted the T-shirts so somehow I managed to buy 2 T-shirts one of Joey from friends and the other was of Sherlock for 1000 rupees plus some delivery charges about 50-60 rupees."
yashsuthar448,Worst delivery service and communication,Worst delivery ?? service!
ishusaxena466i,Pathetic Service,This was my first time using this online store for shopping.as I bought two Tshirts of same size XS but intentionally they sent of the T-shirt XXS. I ordered these item as gifts but when I saw the different sizes it really dissapoints me.how could such a renowned online store make such kind of blunder. I even wrote complain to these guys 2 days ago but these guys are so ignorant that they are not replying any of my mails. Choosing this Crap online store was one of the mistake in my life
josephjthoppil,'Shipment all over India' - is a JOKE !,"I placed my order 13 days ago.The order was my gift to my elder brother on his birth day(July 17).Still I have not received any calls regarding my order.The site has very bare minimum of info. they dont even have the proper collection center name or they dont mention with which provider they mailed you your order. Nothing is there in the website of theirs.LUCKLY I had the good sense to place my order in COD .Finally I had to work with Souled store customer service team and get the Delivery service name(this took 5 days as they were not reachable they talk only via mail)There is a helpline number in the site it is of NO good your call just wont go through(Your welcome to try as soon as you read this contact Number: 022-39653110). Finally after 5 days of investigation SS team reviled the courier service they mailed me'Delhivery'. Pathetic Service from them . They dont call you, they dont pick your calls. they just confirmed that they may have the parcel with them but not sure who has it(For Delhivery to spill the beans it took another 6 days.How very sweet!) The order now is RTO(Return).God knows whats going on here they just dont seem to care. All of you if you want to order in SS fine but please make sure you place it in COD . dont pay upfront. because these guys are not .Only the taglines are attractive!"
snigdhaanand88,Disappointing Purchase!,Ordered posters from here that looked amazing. The cost was approx 300-400 per poster. Obviously was expecting it to come with a frame at that cost. Ordered posters worth 3k and what I got was 8 sheets of paper rolled up in a box!
jchande2,Budget Friendly & Excellent Customer Service,The best part of their product line is that they are cheaper compared to other official merchandise sellers and quality is satisfactory(but not outstanding). Some of their products are printed from manufacturers after order is placed. so it may take additional time to deliver.(keep in mind while ordering)
rashmirr88,Customer Care !! What is that,"I got a mail of successful payment and two mails of non payment of the same order.! Obviously confused, I called their land line contact. The lady attending must have had ""rolling eyes expression"" and was so disinterested that it made me resolve not to order anything from this website in future. Pathetic!"
gurindernarang88,Order delayed.,If you have the patience to wait for 15-20 days for an average product only then place the order. Really bad at delivery and no update whatsoever on the website. THE SOULED STORE: Come on guys we are not living in the 19th century please update yourself and please reply to the emails.
manojrajaram03,Iron man tshirt,This is one of the great print t shirt of marvels iron man  every  single die hard should have this tee.
soemnathdey383,Refund goof ups!,I am writing for website and online purchase experience.  Lots of satisfactory products. But I faced one failed transaction and one ordered and prepaid product not been delivered.  In both the cases the refund process was very lengthy. It took one month for both the cases.

ahmadfarazz333,Soul inviting.,"The souled store is really very good. Earlier I use to find superheroes merchandise at different websites and was not satisfied but this souled store have won my heart. This delivery is really good. It delivers within 3-4 days. The quality of tshirts are very nice. It has really huge collection of funky backpacks, notebooks, tees and badges. They also gives you reward points, so you can use them for discounts for your next purchase. I liked souled store very much."
frhan_reddevil,Amazing Tshirts,"So I saw their Tshirts on Facebook and there were some great designs of superheroes and my favourite tv shows! But I had some doubts ordering clothing online cause I like to wear and make sure that the tshirts feel comfortable to me before buying! ofcourse I couldnt do that online! Also Im a fat guy So Perfect size was also the problem but still I took a chance and ordered a tshirt because I couldnt resist the designs of their tshirts! The tshirt was delivered withing 3 days which made me super happy! The payment options offered by them were also very much convenient! The quality of the tshirts were just out of this world! As soon as I wore the tshirt it felt so comfortable! The size was also perfect, removing all the doubts in my mind! Since then Ive ordered 3 tshirts and it has been a wonderful shopping experience! Im a very satisfied consumer and I recommend all of you to buy from this company!"
poojie7,Order mess up - delay and undone cancellation,Her star rating should be available for this site
xudip,The Souled Army!!,"I came across Souled store official site through facebook. It's a newly launched website that has a good collection of t-shirts at a reasonable price. One can also buy payjamas, boxers, wall art, badges, etc. I was recently surfing through their website & found the Tee's to be amazingly cool with respect to the design. I have already ordered a boxer & have been wearing a wwe ""The Rock"" themed t-shirt. The quality of the cloth is good & it doesn't wear out any sort of color after repeated washing. I didn't notice any bubbles too which is frequent when u shop from online. Overall it has been a decent experience & I would recommend you people to check out once before deciding to buy from another xyz site. One more thing, you can customize your own t-shirt with some catchy quotes from your favorite anime or TV series. Hope this helps!:)"
Prashanth852615,The  Souled Store,"This store or website is really very different from all the stores, the main difference I observed after order confirmation it generates a reward points and the reward points which generated can be used for other purchase, and the products are good they maintain a very good quality I have ordered wwe tees and the quality is very good though It costed 50 rs for shipping It is good , I can recommend this is every one ."
