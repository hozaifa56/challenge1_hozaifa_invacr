Yash Vardhan,Awesome shirts with top notch branding and customer experience.
@pradyotghate,I ordered a Black March Tee. Loved it so much that ordering two more! Wardrobe take over is a real worry.
Gourav,"It was evident that a lot of care, love and passion was involved from designing the tee to the final packaging. Can't wait to tell my friends about it."
Yashwanth Ram,I love your Tees and have purchased 6 of them. I have been completely spoiled by the way the cloth feels on my body and cannot wear other materials anymore. I am on my way to fill my wardrobe with your Tees.
Jivesh Goenka,Re-ordered the blue one. Thanks so much. Kick-ass t-shirts! Keep it up.
Anan Banka,This company doesn't need a return policy. It needs a loyalty program.
Simon,"Very comfortable fit. I could see the amount of craft, attention, that had gone into it. Can't wait to flood my wardrobe with March Tees."
Alok Singh,It fits like a dream. Very comfortable. Never owned a t-shirt like this before. Can't wait to get my hands on more.
drsagariyer,My girlfriend stole one of my March Tee.
madhavag,If Apple made t-shirts.
himanshu_kainth,Most pleasant unboxing I've ever seen. I am in love.
Ravi,Is it awesome or what! I never thought a simple t-shirt could fit so well and be this comfortable.
premdepan,One of the most amazing buying experiences.
Vignesh Moorthy,Love the product and your story telling!
shahsahilv,It's a perfect size and a perfect fit. Never seen a material like this. Looks fab. It was quick at my doorstep as well.
Mohit Pandey,"Overpriced, cloth quality of premium item not upto mark."
hautdegamme,This is fire.
@pradeep5007,Got my first March Tee. It indeed just works.
Antariksh,Finally I get to wear something I was looking for a long long time! A piece of fine craftsmanship.
Mishal Shah,I placed an order the day before yesterday. Got home from work yesterday and it was there. Impressive!
Reva Kalsi,I recently bought the March Tees which you've launched for Women. Hats off to the team who has designed them. Love the fabric and the feel of it.
Bhanu Sinha,"I have never reviewed any item ever however I need to do this. You people have managed to create an awesome product. The fit, the fabric, the stitching, colour, everything about these t-shirts are great. One might think that these are little pricey but they are worth every penny. Great work guys :)"
Pradyumna Malladi,"Four round necks and two polos later, I am completely in love with your product. A t-shirt that feels laid back, relaxed and high quality. I love the feel and check for new colours every week."
Payoor Gopalan,"My son gifted me a tee. Over the years, I have worn many brands and even designed a few. I am sixty nine now but my opinion is that this brand is of high quality and suitable for all ages and occasions. It is a perfect fit and very comfortable to wear."
Ashwin,"I only wear t-shirts from Everlane and Uniqlo, and (dare I say it) - yours seem better. Fit is great, feel is unbelievable."
Tara Thomas,I like how your white tee is not transparent. Good job folks! Ya'll are expensive but totes worth it.
Shivang,"I loved all of them. Right from the fit, the material, the packaging and every other minute detail."
Huzaifa Millwala,"I just received it and tried it on, not only does it look good, but feels great. The sheen of the fabric is wonderful. Ticks all boxes for me."
Vatsal Rustagi,I've worn it for more than ten times in a month. Beautiful product. A brand in making.
Meera Ganapathi,I'm travelling over 15 hours in my March Tee. It's really soft and comfy. I'll be picking up a lot more :)
rahul jain,"too costly, price can be lowered."
