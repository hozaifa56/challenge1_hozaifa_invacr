Perfect for adding in some breath to your neutral colour tees.,4,"I bought one of these in L about 7months ago, and I've been wearing it constantly ever since. When you're wearing a neutral colour outfit, the stripes help it pop out more. It feels super comfortable and the cut is almost perfect, I'd take out a little bit from the length just because I like a little bit of crop in my tees but the length of the sleeves is absolutely perfect. Cotton helps it being breathable as well so yea pretty satisfied and safe to say I've got my worth out of this tee.",Ayman
