"Honest Review from a Customer Experience","26/03/2024","5 out of 5 stars","review star","Purchased size","How it fits","True to size","The T-shirt is super comfortable! I pretty much like the size, it’s oversized. I purchased M sized and it gives a great loose and baggy fit which I really like. So if you want more slim fit, I recommend to buy a smaller size than your usual size.","-","· Male","· 20 to 24 years","· Height: 171 - 175cm","· Weight: 66 - 70kg","· Uttar Pradesh"
